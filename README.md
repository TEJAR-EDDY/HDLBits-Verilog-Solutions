# 🚀 Verilog HDLBits – Complete Solutions Repository

This repository contains my **complete solutions to the HDLBits Verilog problem sets**, structured for clarity and learning impact. It is part of my journey into becoming a **Design & Verification Engineer** in the VLSI domain.

I’ve organized the solutions into topic-wise folders, closely following the original HDLBits platform structure. The goal is to showcase a clean, well-documented, and simulation-ready codebase that reflects strong fundamentals in digital design using Verilog HDL.
